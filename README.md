# io_scene_xrm
A Blender 3.X/4.X+ **work-in-progress** plugin to import and export models for Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I-II Remastered and Tomb Raider I-V Remastered models, expect it to be updated in the near future.
***(THIS PLUGIN WAS TESTED WITH STEAM VERSIONS OF THE GAMES, OTHER VERSIONS ARE UNTESTED!)***
***(HAND AND HEAD MODELS ON TOMB RAIDER ARE UNSUPPORTED, EXPORT IS WORK IN PROGRESS)***

# Features
- **Global**: Functions and parsers are well-documented and print information in the System Console. *(In case you're curious or troubleshooting)*
- **Models**: An import option to import the game's original normals or to recalculate them. *(Looks smoother)*
- **Models**: An import option to import the model's textures which also sets up the shaders in each material node used by the model.
- **Models**: The ability to assign random colors to materials or not. *(To help with distinguishing submeshes)*
